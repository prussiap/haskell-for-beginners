-- Implement your complex number solution yet again, but
-- this time use a type synonym and represent complex
-- numbers using a tuple.
--


-- Create a Result type based on Either that assumes the
-- left side is a String containing an error message. If you're
-- cool, partially apply the type constructor to get new
-- type.
--


-- Define a version of Data.List.find that returns a Result.
-- It should return an error if the list is no matching element
-- is found, with appropriate messages in each case.
