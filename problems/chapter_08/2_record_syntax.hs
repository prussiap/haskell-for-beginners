-- You're going to judge an archery contest. The
-- contests are each going to take some number of
-- shots at a number of targets. Each target has
-- a target area and a point value. The target area
-- is a circle centered on an x,y point with a given
-- radius. Any shot that lands within the target
-- scores the value of the target in points. A shot
-- will only hit the *first* target it is found to
-- be within.
--
-- Define a function to calcuate the total score for
-- a series of shots made by a contestant, given a
-- list of targets. Use record syntax to define your
-- types, and separate your solution into as many functions
-- as you deem appropriate.
