-- Re-implement your complex number solution from section
-- 1 to work with complex numbers for any numeric (Num) type.
--


-- Define a Box type that can hold 0, 1 or 2 items of
-- another type. Define a boxMap function analogous to
-- map on lists for the box type.
--


-- Define a Crate type that can be empty, hold one thing
-- of a type, one thing of another type, or one thing of each
-- of those types. (i.e. it's like a Box, but when holding two
-- items they don't have to be the same type).
--
-- Define a Crate function that flips order of the *types*
-- in the crate. I.E. The type of a Crate holding an Int and
-- a String would change to the type of a Crate holding a String
-- and an Int, even if the Crate was only holding one item.
